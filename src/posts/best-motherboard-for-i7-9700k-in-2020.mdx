  It is true that Intel has not improved a lot in their **CPU** architecture in
  the past five years, which is why they had to increase the core count in the
  processors to compete with AMD Ryzen processors. This increase in core count
  was first seen in the 8th generation Intel processors, where all the three
  series (Core i3, i5, and i7) of processors had gotten two more cores,
  resulting in four, and six cores respectively. 


  When AMD released its 2nd generation processors back in 2018, Intel upped their game again and increased the core count in the Core i7 processors, leading to eight cores. These processors turned out to be quite powerful processors, however, Hyperthreading was removed from the Core i7 processors of the 9th generation. 


  **Intel Core i7-9700K** is the unlocked variant of the Core i7 processor from the 9th generation and provides eight cores and since there is no HyperThreading involved, it provides eight threads as well.


  The processor has a base clock of 3.6 GHz and a turbo clock of 4.9 GHz. This makes it one of the best processors for gaming due to high core count and high operating frequency. It comes with Intel UHD Graphics 630 as integrated graphics, has an L3 cache of 12 MB and a TDP of 95 watts.


  The best thing about this processor is that it is one of the fastest processors for gaming because of high single-core performance. The performance is even higher than the 3rd generation AMD Ryzen processors and that is why those people who want the ultimate performance prefer to buy this processor instead of AMD Ryzen 3700X or 3800X.


  In this article, we will be listing some of the best motherboards that you can couple with this processor for the ultimate gaming experience.
